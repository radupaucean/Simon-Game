# Simon-Game
The project was created using HTML, CSS, javascript and jQuery.
It is a game based on  memorising the last pattern. You have to press a key to start the game and after that a specific color will glow and you have to press it.
Then another one will glow and you have to click them in a chain for as long as you can memorise them.
